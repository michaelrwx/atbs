## == is whether two values are the same. = Puts the variable on the right into the variable on the left

## if statements help flow control. Elif statements are else if statements

#name = ''

#while name != 'your name': #This forces the program to not stop until "your name" is typed verbatim.
#    print('Please type your name.')
#    name = input()

#print('Thank you!')

#there is a not operator
#not True = False
#not False = True

name = 'Mary'
password = 'swordfish'

if name == 'Mary':
    print('Hello, Mary')
    if password == 'swordfish':
        print('Access granted!')
    else:
        print('Wrong password')

#there are elif statements. Or ELSE IF statements!!!

#while loops are blocks of code that let a condition run until it is false

#a break statement stops a while loop if theres a certain condition
